#+startup: overview

* TODO A model to map controller screenshots to controller inputs
** TODO Sprint 1: Data Collection and Preparation [0%]
1. [-] Research: Identify multiple Twitch streams or other sources that showcase controller input display during gameplay. Identify variations in controller display like size, position, color, and design.

2. [ ] Data collection: Extract a diverse range of controller input screenshots from these sources.
3. [ ] Data labeling: Label the collected screenshots with the corresponding controller inputs (e.g., button press, joystick direction, etc.).
4. [ ] Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, this might include resizing, normalization, and perhaps augmentation techniques.
   
** TODO Sprint 2: Model Selection and Initial Training
1. [ ] Literature review: Review existing literature and pre-trained models that might be useful for this task (such as convolutional neural networks, object detection models, etc.).
2. [ ] Model selection: Choose a model architecture based on your research.
3. [ ] Initial training: Train the selected model on your colelcted and preprocessed data.
4. [ ] Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using a validation set.

** TODO Sprint 3: Model Optimization and Testing
1. [ ] Optimization: Based on the performance on the validation set, adjust and optimize the model parameters, including the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc.
2. [ ] Testing: Test the model with a separate test set and calculate performance metrics.
3. [ ] Iterate: Continue to refine and train the model until acceptable performance is achieved.

** TODO Sprint 4: Integration and Demo Development
1. [ ] Integration: Integrate the model with a video game emulator, creating an interface that can feed controller inputs from the model into the emulator.
2. [ ] Demo development: Create a basic demo showcasing the ML model's capability to convert controller input screenshots into actual inputs for the emulator.
3. [ ] Testing and refinement: Test the demo extensively, note any issues or bugs, and refine the solution accordingly.
4. [ ] Documentation: Document the entire process, including the challenges faces, decisions made, and a guide on how to use the demo.

* TODO A program to map a sequence of video screenshots to time series controller inputs

* TODO A dataset of (screenshot,time)->input mappings collected from various games

* TODO Past-masking to generate unsupervised training data (it it now a transformer)?

* TODO Zeroplay: Zero-shot completion of video game canon on retail hardware
